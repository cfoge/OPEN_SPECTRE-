Project aimed at recreating the EMS SPECTRE VIDEO SYNTHESIZER in HDL

The EMS SPECTRE Colour Video
Synthesizer is a unique and revolutionary new product: an instrument capable of producing exciting graphic images on an ordinary television screen. The complete SPECTRE package consists of the synthesizer itself, plus a Sony Trinitron colour monitor, and a Sony black-andwhite TV camera. The synthesizer is compact (38"x23.5"x7"), portable (about 35 pounds), and unequalled in its simplicity and versatility.
