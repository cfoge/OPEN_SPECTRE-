# Cloning a process, not a device

While the EMS SPECTRE is a unique and wonderful device, it was made as a product of its time, with limitations and concessions.  The device was produced as an exploration of what might be possible using the cutting-edge technology of time time. Using a technology-up approach where aesthetics and features were derived directly from that made sense electronically. Therefore this project aims to follow that same, circuit-first approach to any new features we might add. Cloning the original circuity will give us a place to start and a clear impression of the technical paradigm the device sits within. 

## Above all else we want this new device to be able to do two things. 
- Create anything that was possible to create on the original Ems Spectre, using a logic gate path like the original.
- Be a fun, creative rich and unique device for modern video artists and musicians to create with.

These two goals set a distinction, between our process and the typical ethos of a synth clone. It needs to be able to do all the same stuff, we don’t want to stay true to what the device ended up being, we want to stay true to what the device was trying to be. 

### Replicating the original signal paths isn’t important because the original circuit was the platonic ideal of perfection, it’s important because of its idiosyncrasies and errors.

For example, the spectre has a chaotic and non-standard way of mixing colours, that is utterly foreign to anyone used to the RGB(A) standards of modern video equipment. This leads to a distinct and vibrant colour pallet that sets the device apart. This is an Idiosyncrasy that we want to preserve as it reflects the creative methodology and workflow the device imparts to its users.

A key example of how the device might be changed in this modern version is replacing the pin matrix with a digital parameter controller. However, in replacing the hardware, we still aim to preserve the kind of interaction the pin matrix brought, the idea of creative complex webs of signal paths, which you could always see at a glance. We want to replace the hardware but not the workflow.

Another way we might diverge from the original design is dynamics. The EMS Spectre is a device that’s quite hard to perform with. It struggles to keep up with the dynamics required for live video performance today. So adding more features to enable dynamic playability, in a way that fits the original workflow of the device, will be something to strive for.
